QUESTIONS : 

a) How many types of tigers can be found in the taxonomy table of the dataset? What is the "ncbi_id" of the Sumatran Tiger? (hint: use the biological name of the tiger)
=>
SELECT  count(distinct species) as Types_of_Tigers
FROM Rfam.taxonomy;
----------------------------
SELECT ncbi_id
FROM Rfam.taxonomy
WHERE species = 'Panthera tigris sumatrae';

b) Find all the columns that can be used to connect the tables in the given database.
=> rfam_acc, refseq_acc , ncbi_id , auto_wiki , clan_acc

c) Which type of rice has the longest DNA sequence? (hint: use the rfamseq and the taxonomy tables)
=>
SELECT rt.species
FROM Rfam.rfamseq AS rf
INNER JOIN Rfam.taxonomy AS rt ON rf.ncbi_id = rt.ncbi_id
WHERE rt.species LIKE '%rice%'
ORDER BY rf.length DESC
LIMIT 1;

d) We want to paginate a list of the family names and their longest DNA sequence lengths (in descending order of length) where only families that have DNA sequence lengths greater than 1,000,000 are included. Give a query that will return the 9th page when there are 15 results per page. (hint: we need the family accession ID, family name and the maximum length in the results)
=>
SELECT rf.rfamseq_acc, rf.description, MAX(rf.length) AS max_length
FROM Rfam.rfamseq AS rf
WHERE rf.length > 1000000
GROUP BY rf.rfamseq_acc, rf.description
ORDER BY max_length DESC
LIMIT 15 OFFSET 120;
